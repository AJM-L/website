                            Think of the last time you took time to learn a new <strong>skill</strong> from your grandpa or sat down to let your great-uncle
                            tell you a <strong>story</strong> from his younger years. When will these stories be lost to time forever?

                            As technology becomes more integrated into daily interactions, aging populations face increasing challenges in
                            connecting with their families and communities. <strong>Livebrary</strong> ensures that a legacy of <strong>wisdom</strong> and <strong>experience</strong> is captured
                            and shared, bridging generational gaps.

                        <p>
                            Our primary and secondary research identified several key needs among seniors, including:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Community</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Continued hobbies</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Respect</strong> &amp; <strong>feeling seen</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Patience</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>To be remembered</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            We conducted in-person field research and interviews with seniors in <strong>Claremont, California</strong>, as well as interviews
                            with younger students. These insights highlighted the necessity for <strong>community connection</strong>, as well as the importance of 
                            <strong>intuitive design</strong> to reduce frustration when using technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Secondary research, including discussions on <strong>Quora</strong> and <strong>Reddit</strong> (r/Aging) and studies like the <strong>National Poll on Healthy Aging</strong>,
                            underscored the prevalence of <strong>isolation</strong> and <strong>loneliness</strong> among older adults.

                        <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
                        <p>
                            In contrast to existing social media platforms which primarily cater to younger users, <strong>Livebrary's design</strong> addresses the
                            unique needs of seniors. Our decisions focused on:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Creating a clear, simple interface to reduce <strong>cognitive overload</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Ensuring <strong>intuitive navigation</strong> with assisted tutorials and comprehensive setup guides.</li>
                            <li>Leveraging <strong>live streaming</strong> and <strong>pre-recorded video</strong> to simulate face-to-face interactions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Prototype testing with seniors confirmed that features such as toggling between <strong>"sharing"</strong> and <strong>"learning"</strong> modes are best
                            implemented using clear, distinct button states.
