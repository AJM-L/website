My journey in computer science began in high school when I discovered the creative potential of programming through a Python-based "Coding with Inquiry" course. The class was largely project based, so I decided to build a recursive minimax algorithm for tic-tac-toe. This love of software continued throughout the end of my highschool career and in my senior year, I developed a multilayer perceptron without ML libraries to classify MNIST handwritten digits at >90% accuracy, laying the foundation for my fascination with AI/ML systems.
At Claremont McKenna College, I deepened my technical expertise through coursework spanning object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithm design, while simultaneously expanding my toolkit through self-directed learning. Over my first summer in college, I began learning full-stack development by building proficiency in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, and Flask—skills I later applied to create production-grade applications like EasyDocumentReader.com. This AI-powered PDF-to-speech converter combines Python/Flask backend architecture with Azure OCR and LMNT TTS APIs, secured through JWT authentication and password protection.
My professional experiences reflect balanced technical execution and strategic problem-solving:
Enterprise AI Development: Designed UI/UX prototypes in Figma for IBM's InstructLab, validated through developer testing to optimize WatsonX model training workflows
ML Engineering: Developed custom deep convolutional GANs with PyTorch to generate synthetic Pinterest-style imagery through web scraping and neural network training
Systems Optimization: Engineered SEO strategies that elevated Faluna LLC's Google ranking from unlisted to top 5 positions, achieving 20% CTR through data-driven A/B testing
I maintain active engagement with emerging technologies through projects like my Spotify Playlist Art Generator (OpenAI API integration) and continuous exploration of new frameworks and languages. My academic background in philosophy and mathematics informs my approach to software design—I combine analytical rigor with user-centric design principles to build solutions that balance technical elegance with practical utility.
Currently expanding my expertise in distributed systems and cloud architecture, I bring full-stack versatility, machine learning proficiency, and product development acumen to software engineering challenges. From implementing secure authentication protocols to training custom neural networks, I thrive at the intersection of technical execution and creative problem-solving.
